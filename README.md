# Movie-_Rating system using Python

# Introduction

* Movies have a significant cultural impact, and audience ratings play a crucial role in their success. This project aims to develop a Python-based movie 
  rating system that processes user reviews and assigns meaningful ratings.

# Objective

* Develope a python-only movie rating system.
* Allow users to input ratings for movies.
* Store and display ratings effeciently using python logic.
  
# Methodology

* User Input Handling: Accept movie ratings from users via Python scripts.
* Data Processing: Store, retrieve, and manage rating data using file handling or Python dictionaries.
* Rating Calculation: Compute movie ratings based on predefined logic or averaging user inputs.

# Implementation

* Programming Language: Python
* Key Modules Used: File handling, dictionaries, lists
* Code Flow: User inputs ratings → Data is stored → Ratings are displayed/analyzed

# Results and Findings
* Successfully allowed users to rate movies using Python scripts.
* Demonstrated how Python alone can manage a simple movie rating system.

# Conclusion

* This project effectively showcases a Python-only approach to handling movie ratings. Future improvements might involve GUI integration for better user 
  experience.
